# Exercise 2: List Accessible Documents

## Problem Statement

In this exercise, you'll learn how to determine all documents that a specific user has access to. This builds on the basic access check by performing multiple checks to compile a complete list of accessible resources.

Your tasks:
1. Create a Python script that lists all documents a user can read or write
2. Implement separate functions for checking read and write access
3. Generate a user-friendly report of accessible documents

## Scenario

Using the existing authorization model with users and documents from the system:
- Find all documents that `anne_smith` can read
- Find all documents that `bob_jones` can write
- Compare access levels (read vs. write) for `clara_zhang`

## Instructions

1. Create a new file `list_accessible_documents.py` in the fga_example folder
2. Implement a function that uses the OpenFGA SDK to list all documents a user can access
3. Create separate functions for read and write access checks
4. Format the results to show the difference between read-only and write access

## Hints


## Solution

The solution for this exercise is currently TBA (To Be Announced).

Good luck!

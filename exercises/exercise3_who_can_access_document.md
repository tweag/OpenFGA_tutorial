# Exercise 3: Who Can Access a Document

## Problem Statement

In this exercise, you'll learn how to determine all users who have access to a specific document. This is essentially the reverse of the previous exercise and is useful for auditing and managing document permissions.

Your tasks:
1. Create a Python script that lists all users who can access a specific document
2. Implement functions to check both read and write access
3. Generate a comprehensive access report for a document

## Scenario

You need to audit access to several important documents in your system:
- Determine all users who can read `document:2`
- Find all users who can write to `document:6` 
- Create a full access report showing both readers and writers for `document:1`

## Instructions

1. Create a new file `document_access_audit.py` in the fga_example folder
2. Implement a function that lists all users who can read a specific document
3. Implement a function that lists all users who can write to a specific document
4. Create a combined function that generates a complete access report

## Hints

## Solution

The solution for this exercise is currently TBA (To Be Announced).

Good luck!

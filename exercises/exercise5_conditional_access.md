# Exercise 5: Conditional Document Access Based on Publication Status

## Problem Statement

In this exercise, you'll learn how to extend the OpenFGA authorization model to include conditional access based on document publication status. You'll modify the model to only allow public access to published documents.

Your tasks:
1. Extend the OpenFGA model to incorporate document publication status
2. Update the model in the OpenFGA server
3. Create test scenarios to validate the new rules
4. Implement a client-side function to check access with publication conditions

## Scenario

Your document management system needs enhanced authorization rules:
- Unpublished documents should only be accessible to team members
- Published documents can be viewed by anyone with folder access
- Document owners should always have access regardless of publication status

## Instructions

1. Create a new file `extended_model.fga` with your modified authorization model
2. Implement the new conditional relations based on publication status
3. Write a Python script to update the model in the OpenFGA server
4. Create test cases that demonstrate the conditional access rules

## Hints


## Solution

The solution for this exercise is currently TBA (To Be Announced).

Good luck!
